HttpClient Configuration
------------------------

HttpClientConfig class, we are configuring mainly two things

1. PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager

=>It connect to pool manager
=>Connections are pooled on a per route basis
=>A request for a route which already the manager has persistent connections
for available in the pool will be services by leasing a connection from the pool 
rather than creating a brand new connection

=>ConnectionKeepAliveStrategy helps in setting time which decide how long
  A connection can remain idle before being reused
  And set a idleConnectionMonitor thread, which periodically check all connections
  And free up which have not been used and idle time has elapsed
